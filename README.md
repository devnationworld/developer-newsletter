Every fortnight we'll share our developer newsletter which is packed full of resources and latest news. If you have a resource that you think we should share in our next issue. Drop a note in [Discussions.](https://github.com/devnationworld/developer-newsletter/discussions)

Resources from our earlier newsletters can be found in our [resources](https://github.com/devnationworld/resources) repo.
